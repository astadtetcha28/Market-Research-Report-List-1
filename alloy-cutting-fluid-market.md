<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alloy Cutting Fluid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil-based</li><li>Water-based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The alloy cutting fluid market is divided into two main types: oil-based and water-based fluids. Oil-based cutting fluids offer excellent lubrication, reducing friction and heat during machining, which enhances tool life and workpiece finish. They are ideal for heavy-duty machining but may pose environmental and health concerns. On the other hand, water-based cutting fluids, often containing emulsifiers and additives, provide effective cooling and are easier to clean. They are more environmentally friendly but may offer less lubrication compared to oil-based options.</p></p>
